            <h2>Hi.  My name is Joel and I have three young daughters.  Sometimes it's hard to balance it all.</h2>
            
            <p>In this survival guide, I will teach you my proven secrets how to do it.</p>

            <p>Looking at my typical day, here are some (in no particular order), items I might be responsible for:
                <ul>
                    <li>Making dinner for the family.</li>
                    <li>Getting the girls dressed in the morning and making them breakfast.</li>
                    <li>Doing a short grocery run after work.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
            One way to simplify life is to have a few easy meals you can cook practically instantly.  Of course, I'd still like them to be healthy though, not just mac 'n cheese.
            Now, some dining plans like Blue Apron say "easy to cook in just 15 minutes" but really it's 5 minutes to open the box and remove all the packaging waste, another half 
            hour to chop everything super tiny, and then another 15 to cook.  It's another 30 minutes to Google what I should do with all that waste, <i>especially</i> the frozen
            "ice" packets, which say "DO NOT PUT DOWN DRAIN" (exactly what I wanted to do).  30 minutes later and 15 Chrome tabs open learning all about waste and toxins, the 
            "ice" packets are in the trash, surely leaking out into a horrible mess that the trash man is going to drip all over my driveway the next day...
            </p>

            <p>So yeah, not like that.</p>

            <p>These meals are classic staples in any strapping father's repertoire.  But don't just take my word for it, hear what my customers are saying.</p>

                Here is where I would normally offer you my free e-guide to fathering, in exchange for your precious email address.  But there is literally no more content I have to
                share with you.  Sure, there can always be more meals.  But I'd have to write a whole book to really bring you up to speed.  And due to the whole nature of a father 
                who is stretched too thin, it means everthing gets the bare minimum, including this assignment, so that I can move on to the next thing demanding my attention.
