            Some people don't like leftovers.  I don't get that.  Well, I guess if it was homemade then I get that.  But to me, leftovers means "leftover
            from a restaurant the night before," which to me is a treat.  When we decide if the girls should split a meal, I always say "No, cause they could
            always have the rest for dinner tomorrow."  My wife and I both know that I will be the one eating it the next day.

            Get out the leftovers from the fridge.

        </p>
        <p>
            Put the leftovers into the microwave.  Turn on for 2 minutes or until you hear awful popping sounds.  No plate is necessary, serve right out of
            the carryout box to avoid washing a dish.
