## Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a personal website completed as a part of Harvard's CS50Web course on website programming.  It consists of four main HTML files.

#### Overall Design Method
The whole design is based on Bootstrap 4 and uses Sass to compile to CSS code.  I have integrated it with a theme (Minty) from Bootswatch.  
For more info on customizing your own theme using Bootswatch, see [this link](https://bootswatch.com/help/).
The design is responsive and mobile-friendly.

###### index.html
This is the main file, where I explain what the site is about and link to some more content.  I have mockup customer testimonials, a table, and a form at the bottom (which doesn't do anything).  


###### _bootswatch.scss and _variables.scss
These files are where I make modifications for particular `.id` and `.class` HTML tags.  There are many examples in there of modified SCSS variables, SCSS nesting, and SCSS inheritance.  

###### friedeggs.html, hotdog.html and leftovers.html
These files are all recipes linked to from the table in index.html.  They contain images and some more custom classes.
